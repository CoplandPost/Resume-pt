                    The company's business rule is advertising, offering artwork creation services, material printing and distribution in areas contracted by the client. I developed an application which offers several features to streamline processes and facilitate the user experience during a purchase or campaign management. The application works a lot with geographic coordinates, maps, etc. One of the examples is that the user adds the areas where he wants to carry out the distribution, our application searches in our base of agents which is the closest and most available agent, and offers the work for that agent, by SMS, Email or Mobile App notification. Our application tracks the entire campaign, collecting the agent's path, creating the polylyne, and sending the data to the client as evidence of the areas where it was worked. We also created fences to ensure that agents do not leave the contracted radius. We have several modules to manage other departments of the company, such as Finance, Human Resources, etc.
